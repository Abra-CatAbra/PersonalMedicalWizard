# PersonalMedicalWizard Roadmap

## Project Philosophy
**Build incrementally. Test thoroughly. Don't over-engineer.**

## Execution Strategy
1. **One phase at a time** - Complete each phase before moving to next
2. **Git commits after each milestone** - Keep history clean
3. **Test before adding features** - Stability > Features
4. **Document as we go** - Update CLAUDE.md with decisions

## üéØ Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal: Stable, error-resistant base**

### Sprint 1.1: Error Handling
- [ ] Add try-catch to all endpoints
- [ ] Validate file formats (JPEG, PNG only)
- [ ] Handle model loading failures
- [ ] Add request size limits

### Sprint 1.2: Logging & Monitoring
- [ ] Setup Python logging
- [ ] Add request/response logging
- [ ] Create health check endpoint
- [ ] Add basic metrics (process time, success rate)

### Sprint 1.3: Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for image preprocessing
- [ ] API endpoint tests
- [ ] Frontend upload tests
- [ ] Error scenario tests

**Deliverable:** Stable app that handles errors gracefully

---

## ‚ö° Phase 2: Performance (Week 2)
**Goal: 10x faster response times**

### Sprint 2.1: Caching
- [ ] Setup Redis container
- [ ] Implement result caching (image hash ‚Üí results)
- [ ] Add cache TTL and size limits
- [ ] Cache hit/miss metrics

### Sprint 2.2: Async Processing
- [ ] Implement job queue (Celery)
- [ ] WebSocket for progress updates
- [ ] Batch processing endpoint
- [ ] Background model warm-up

### Sprint 2.3: Optimization
- [ ] Model quantization (reduce size by 75%)
- [ ] ONNX conversion for inference
- [ ] Client-side image resizing
- [ ] Lazy model loading

**Deliverable:** Sub-2-second analysis time

---

## üöÄ Phase 3: Features (Week 3)
**Goal: Production-ready features**

### Sprint 3.1: Medical Formats
- [ ] DICOM file support
- [ ] NIfTI compatibility
- [ ] Metadata extraction
- [ ] Anonymization tools

### Sprint 3.2: Reporting
- [ ] PDF report generation
- [ ] Customizable templates
- [ ] Confidence visualizations
- [ ] Export to CSV/JSON

### Sprint 3.3: Advanced Analysis
- [ ] Heatmap generation
- [ ] Region of interest detection
- [ ] Comparative analysis
- [ ] Trend tracking

**Deliverable:** Feature-complete medical tool

---

## üè≠ Phase 4: Production (Week 4)
**Goal: Deployment ready**

### Sprint 4.1: Infrastructure
- [ ] Docker compose setup
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Environment configs

### Sprint 4.2: Security
- [ ] API authentication
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] HTTPS setup
- [ ] Data encryption

### Sprint 4.3: Compliance
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] HIPAA considerations
- [ ] Data retention policies
- [ ] Terms of service

**Deliverable:** Production-deployed application

---

## Success Metrics
- **Phase 1:** Zero unhandled errors in 24hr test
- **Phase 2:** <2 sec analysis time, 90% cache hit rate
- **Phase 3:** Support 5 file formats, generate reports
- **Phase 4:** 99.9% uptime, pass security audit

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
‚ùå Adding features before fixing bugs
‚ùå Optimizing before measuring
‚ùå Building complex UI before backend is solid
‚ùå Committing broken code
‚ùå Working on multiple phases simultaneously

## Decision Log
- Chose Redis over Memcached for persistence
- FastAPI over Flask for async support
- ONNX over TensorRT for portability
- Vanilla JS initially, React later if needed
